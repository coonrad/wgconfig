# wgconfig
A simple bash script to output wireguard configurations with public and private key.

```bash
[vpnuser@mypc]~$ wgconfig

Enter values for any or all fields or none to generate keypair only

Filename (example client01) =
Address (example: 10.0.0.2/30) =
ListenPort (return for dynamic endpoint) =
DNS servers separated by comma (return for none) =
PresharedKey (return for none) =
Remote peer PublicKey =
AllowedIPs (separated by comma, 0.0.0.0/0 for default) =
Endpoint (hostname or IP address) =
Endpoint listenport =

### configuration saved as wireguard.conf
```

## Configuration output template

```ini
# Name = wireguard.conf

# Configuration format is INI.
# There are two top level sections: Interface and Peer
[Interface]

# Private key generated by wg genkey
PrivateKey =

# Public key derived from private key with wg pubkey
# Provide to remote peer
# Publickey =

# Comma separated list of addresses, CIDR notation optional
# Multiple addresses allowed
Address =

# Optional 16-bit listen port
# Don't set if this peer has a dynamic IP address
# ListenPort =

# Comma separated list of addresses for DNS service
# Or hostnames to be set as search domains
# DNS =

# Manually specify MTU
# MTU = 1420

# Multiple peer configurations allowed
[Peer]

# Public key provided by remote peer
PublicKey =

# Optional preshared key generated by wg genpsk
# Adds addtional layer of cryptography for post-quantum resistance
# PresharedKey =

# Comma separated list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses with CIDR masks
# For incoming traffic allowed and outgoing traffic directed
# Use 0.0.0.0/0 and/or ::/0 for default route
AllowedIPs =

# IP or hostname followed by colon and port number
# Don't set if remote peers have dynamic addresses
# Endpoint =

# Keepalive interval between 1 and 65535
# Useful for keeping NAT or stateful firewall connections active
# PersistentKeepalive = 25
```
